## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

### What I learned

Wow!  Being only a week or so into JavaScript, this project took longer than expected as I had to review topics such as functions, loops, and scope.  That said, I'm proud because I really challenged myself to not peek at other solutions for this problem and work a solution by myself using the concepts I knew.  

The biggest thing that helped me do this was breaking down the project into smaller bits.  Once I got a particular function working, I would then move on to the next.  There were some times where I had to go back and tweak a previous function, but this method still helped me stay focused and make steady progress.

As of now, the game is currently played in the console.

### Continued development

This project will be revisited and dressed up with HTML and CSS in the near future.

### Useful resources
